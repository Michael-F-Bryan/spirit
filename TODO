* Another Opt structure with -v and such.
* Run the backgroud thread as a task in tokio?
* Why C needs to be Debug?
* config_exts_all?

* Where are all the errors if validation of config fails? One of them seems to
  be missing somewhere (or maybe all and that's only what gets printed in case
  it bubbles one level up).

* unify Order of Opts/Config

* Reintroduce scaling
* Guard keeper and waiting for the background thread to terminate
  - For stuff like async logging
* Parts of the core spirit can be split off and useful separately â€’ base traits, config loading. Then, if the user doesn't want the background thread and stuff, it can be used manually.
