* Another Opt structure with -v and such.
* Run the backgroud thread as a task in tokio?
* Why C needs to be Debug?
* config_exts_all?
* Maybe log-errors as a macro?

* Error logging: allow specifying the level, allow single-line format
* Where are all the errors if validation of config fails? One of them seems to
  be missing somewhere (or maybe all and that's only what gets printed in case
  it bubbles one level up).

* unify Order of Opts/Config

* Reintroduce scaling
